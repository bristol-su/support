Although a module consists of a lot of behind the scenes work, one of the most used parts is the frontend. That is, the actual pages that users of the portal will utilise.

NOTE: You may use any type of frontend you like - the portal doesn't have anything to do with dispaying your frontend. We recommend using the stack described in this documentation for increased support & compatibility though!
