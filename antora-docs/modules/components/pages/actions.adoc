= Actions

All actions inherit an interface Action.

Events using interface TriggerableEvent must implement methods

getFields -> returns all fields in the event and their value. e.g., for
a 'file uploaded event', we could return

....
[
    'file_name' => 'Uploaded File Name',
    'file_size' => 60087,
    'uploaded_at' => 01/01/2020 10:00:00
];
....

getFieldMetaData ->

Returns information about the field in a human readable form. Must
return an array with the field key as the index, and the value as:

....
[
    'label' => 'Human Readable Label',
    'helptext' => 'A description of the value'
];
....

We associate specific actions with events, then execute the action when
the event fires.

Registering actions

To register an action, we use the ActionManagerFacade or the
ActionManager class from the container.

....
ActionManagerFacade::registerAction(ActionClass::class, 'Name of the action', 'A description of the action');â€‹
....

....
$this->app->make(\BristolSU\Support\Action\ActionManager::class)->registerAction(ActionClass::class, 'Name of the action', 'A description of the action');
....

The action manager is a singleton, and stores the actions in a property
for the duration of the request lifetime. If directly retrieved, an
action will be represented by an array as follows

....
[
    'name' => 'Name of the action,
    'class' => ActionClass::class,
    'description' => 'Description of the action'
]
....

Therefore, it is recommended to use the ActionRepository, which converts
this into a RegisteredAction class, which is a simple class that
provides helper methods for getting the meta data (name and description)
and class name without using array indices. The fromClass method
retrieves an action by the class of the action, such as
ActionClass::class.

To associate an action with an event and persist this information, we
use Action Instances, which hold a reference to the event and the
action, and the field mapping. The ActionInstance class is a Laravel
model which holds this information. When we associate an event with an
action, we create a new ActionInstance row, which holds the following
information:

* Name and description for identifying the action instance. E.g. 'Send
an email when a new document is uploaded'.
* Event. Holds the class name of the event
* Action: Holds the class name of the action
* Module instance ID

Because the ActionInstance is attached to a specific module instance
(you only want to send an email when a document is uploaded to one
module, not any upload file module!), we need to store the module
instance. When the event is fired, we resolve the module instance out of
the container to determine the module instance that caused the event to
be fired.

The ActionDispatcher triggers for every event that implements
TriggerableEvent. It searches for action instances in the database
associated with the module instance, and where the event is the event
that has been fired, then uses the builder to build the action.

The builder (ActionBuilder) creates a new Action class of the type given
by the action instance, and passes it the simple field mapping. For
example, if an event had a 'file_name' key, and the action had a
'message' field for a message to log, the action_instance_field would
contain

....
[
    'event_field' => 'file_name',
    'action_field' => 'message',
    'action_instance_id' => 1
];
....

Finally, the dispatcher dispatches the action, holding the correct
parameters, and the queue will work it in the background.
