= Helpers

helpers defines a few useful functions. These tend to be based around
resolving classes from the container and calling methods, and should be
thought of as helpers to keep clean code, as opposed to the only way to
do the function.

settings($key, $default)

Retrieves a setting value for a module. To be used in a module instance,
it resolves the module instance and finds the setting with the given
key. If the key doesn't exist, we return the default value (null by
default).

alias()

Get the alias of the currently injected Module Instance.

hasPermission($ability, $user, $group, $role)

Tests to see if the user/group/role has the permission with the ability
$ability. Leave $user, $group and $role blank to test the currently
authenticated user.
