Any SDK implementation will use the default Laravel storage framework, built on FlySystem, to upload files and assets. Make sure to always put any assets or files you upload into a folder with your module alias in it. For example, upload a file called file.txt with a name `'my-alias/file.txt'`

This will allow us to tell different module assets apart in storage.
